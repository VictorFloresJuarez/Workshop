# Permissions

Let's take a look at the available permissions:

Actually the permissions are quite explicit in the capabilities they provide to the bot. That is why only one clarification will be made, regarding the general permissions:

First, analyze carefully if your bot really needs any of these permissions, because it has very powerful permissions such as kick members or banning them. Therefore, also as a recommendation, do not give all permissions to the bot, only give it the essential ones. 

Don't worry if your bot needs more permissions in the future, you can always update its permissions list.
