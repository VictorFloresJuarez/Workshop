# Audio functions

To begin, we will follow the first 3 steps of the main project.
If you need help remembering those 3 steps, you can go back to the index of steps right [here](https://github.com/VictorFloresJuarez/Workshop-Bots-on-Discord/blob/main/Sections/Creation%20process/Index%20of%20steps.md)

## Step 4: Create your files: main.py and music.py on Replit
The first thing we're gonna is create our main.py and then import discord.py so we can work with discord commands.

 Then we're going to initialize our bot using commands and using our token. At this point, you should already know how to get your token but if you don't remember, you can check [here](https://github.com/VictorFloresJuarez/Workshop-Bots-on-Discord/blob/main/Sections/Creation%20process/%3EStep2+++/Step4.md). Your code should look like this:
 
![token](https://github.com/VictorFloresJuarez/Workshop-Bots-on-Discord/blob/main/Resources/paso4.token.png?raw=true)
 
 After this, we need to create a new file and we're going to call it music.py. On this file, we need to import discord.py again and also import youtube.dl, basically so we can work with youtube videos and music. If you want to read more about youtube.dl, you can search more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl). Finally, your music.py file should look like this:
 
![music](https://github.com/VictorFloresJuarez/Workshop-Bots-on-Discord/blob/main/Resources/paso4.music.png?raw=true)

## Step 5: Start the coding
First, we need to initialize our class music adding the class music and the setup function.
